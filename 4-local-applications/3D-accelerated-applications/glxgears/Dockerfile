# Run glxgears in a container.
# This image uses the simple approach of sharing the host's X11 socket and GPU
# device with the container. This method requires the container, GPU device and
# display to be on the same host, but gives performance that is equivalent to
# running the application directly (i.e. not in a container) on the host.
