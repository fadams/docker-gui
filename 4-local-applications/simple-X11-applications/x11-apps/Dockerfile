# An image to run x11-apps, a miscellaneous assortment of X applications that
# ship with the X Window System.
# This image uses the simple approach of sharing the host's X11 socket with
# the container and using xhost or Xauthority to authenticate with the X Server.
# This method requires the container and display to be on the same host, but
# gives performance that is equivalent to running the application directly
# (i.e. not in a container) on the host.

#FROM debian:stretch-slim # Deprecated
FROM ubuntu:24.04

# Install x11-apps
RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    # Add the packages used
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
	x11-apps && \
	rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

CMD ["xlogo"]
