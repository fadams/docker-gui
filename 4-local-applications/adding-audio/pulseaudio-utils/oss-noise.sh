# Run pacat in a container. Illustrates running a pulseaudio client example
# in a container and forwarding the audio via the pulseaudio socket to the host.
# This script uses the simple approach of sharing the host's pulse socket with
# the container. This method requires the container and pulse server to be on
# the same host as the pulse socket is a Unix domain socket bind-mounted in
# the container.
