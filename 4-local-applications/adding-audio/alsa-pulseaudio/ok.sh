# Run ALSA's aplay in a container, but also include pulseaudio so that the ALSA
# default device is actually pulseaudio. By doing this we don't have to add
# any real hardware devices, so the container doesn't need --device=/dev/snd
# nor do we need to add the user to the audio group. This approach is much
# closer to running a pulseaudio client in a container than it is to running
# a raw ALSA client and there should be less to go wrong.
