# The -e WEBKIT_DISABLE_SANDBOX_THIS_IS_DANGEROUS=1 is a workaround for
# changes in ubuntu:24.04 and related distros that gate unprivileged
# user namespaces by apparmor confinement. This applies at the application
# level so applies even if docker's --security-opt apparmor=unconfined is
# set. A better approach would be a custom apparmor profile for epiphany
# but for now just disable the user namespace sandbox :-(
