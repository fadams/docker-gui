# Visual Studio Code on Linux
#
# This Dockerfile builds the vscode Desktop IDE.
# That is to say the one you'd install by visiting:
# https://code.visualstudio.com/
# then downloading and installing the .deb from the web page link.
#
# The download URL used below was grokked from a manual download.
# https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/ea3859d4ba2f3e577a159bc91e3074c5d85c0523/code_1.52.1-1608136922_amd64.deb

# Visual Studio Code allows for remote development in containers.
# The Visual Studio Code Remote Containers extension lets you use a Docker
# container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open
# any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual
# Studio Code's full feature set. A devcontainer.json file in your project
# tells VS Code how to access (or create) a development container with a
# well-defined tool and runtime stack. This container can be used to run an
# application or to sandbox tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working
# with a codebase.
#
# https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers
# https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial
# https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-develop-inside-a-container-using-visual-studio-code-remote-containers/
#
# Note that the above tutorials assume vscode IDE is installed on desktop
# not in a container, so the instruction "Once the process starts, navigate
# to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the simple Node.js server
# running!" will fail. To resolve this use the IP of either the
# vsc-vscode-remote... container or the vscode container itself e.g. via
# docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' container_name_or_id
# Alternatively, launch the container in the host's network namespace
# by adding --network=host to the launch script.
#
# To enable this capability we install the docker CLI in this image
# and bind-mount the docker socket in the container.
